Component-Based Entities


This is a small Javascript game engine using the component-based entity model. Each game-object (entity) is broken into its constituent parts (components) and these are stored for processing by independent processes (systems). Systems communicate with eachother by subscribing and publishing to certain message types via a relaying object (observer).

This project is still in its infancy. More details to come..
